# Import Quiver plugin

This plugin allows you to import notes from Quiver Library(`Quiver.qvlibrary`).

This plugin has only been tested on macOS.

I hope you find this feature useful.

# usage

+ Install this plugin.
+ File -> Import -> from Quiver Library, then the file dialog opens.
+ Select your Quiver Library (`Quiver.qvlibrary`).
+ Wait a moment, then import finishes.

Running this plugin will automatically create new books and tags and import your notes.

If the book or tag already exists, it will not be created.
